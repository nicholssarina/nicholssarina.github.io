    <p> Hi, my name is Sarina, and that is a picture of my cat and I. My pronouns are <i>she/her/hers.</i> I am a senior majoring in Strategic Communication and my minor is, of course, CTD.</p>
    <p> I am so excited to be able to develop my own websites. It has been a goal of mine for a very long time.</p>
    <p> A little more about myself, I am a creative at heart. I love to paint and draw, but music is where my passion truly lies. I am a muscian and an <b>avid</b> record collector.</p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O40owaQpkB4"> I'll close out with my favorite video on YouTube.</a>
